        at the very end there is an important question for you</p>

        <h1 class="title">Love</h1>
        <p class="subtext">Hey Nat, I know you have probably already clicked on the question<br>
        but if you haven't please just continue scrolling. I wanted to create this site to show<br>
        you how much I really love you. I know at the end of the day its really just words<br>
        but it truly means more than that to me. I really love you. You are my first thought<br>
        when I wake up and my last thought before I go to bed, and you're all I think about<br>
        throughout the day. I know you have trouble believing people and I know I am no such<br>
        exception but I really hope you'll value this. I love you a lot Nathaly <3</p>

        <p class="subtext">So our first messages, started out on roblox of all places<br>
        The first message ever sent was on October 21, 2023, at 6:09 PM<br>
        I was just trying to get your discord lmao. I will forever cherish this day<br>
        as my life has changed significantly with you in it.<br>
        you have most definitely changed my life for the better and im really hoping<br>
        that we last forever. I truly love you and I honestly have no clue what I would<br>
        do without you. I know I am a piece of work, I know I overcomplicate things<br>
        a lot and I know I don't say it enough but THANK YOU. For sticking with me<br>
        through our moments and when we get upset with each other. I truly value you<br>
        and I seriously love you. I am so in love with you its insane. I know I don't<br>
        say this enough and I know I probably should, but I know you get nervous<br>
        a lot and the last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="future" class="future">
        <h1 class="title">Future</h1>
        <p class="subtext">I know a lot of couples say this, but I really want us<br>
        to last forever. I really want to be with you forever. I know that is near<br>
        impossible but there is a chance that we work out. I know I make a lot of dumb<br>
        choices and I can't remember anything to save my damn life, but I really hope that<br>
        you don't think it's because I don't love you. I think my horrible memory stems from<br>
        the trauma I received as a kid. It might not sound as bad, but I really haven't explained<br>
        the years of torture I went through. This is mostly due to the fact that I can't remember it<br>
        but lets not get hung up on me. This site is for you. In the future, I really want us to<br>
        get married, I want to start a family with you and I want to be able to 'Let me ask<br>
        my wife' the hell out of absolutely everyone. I want to be able to experience life with<br>
        you in it forever. I really want to be able to wake up next to you every morning<br>
        you are the girl that I truly want to spend the rest of my life with. I didn't really<br>
        think love was a real thing before I met you. I never really thought love was for me<br>
        especially taking my multiple failed attempts to actually get a girlfriend.<br>
        I love you.</p>

    <div id="question" class="question">
        <h1 class="title">Question</h1>
        <p class="subtext">I know you have been waiting for this for a while. And if you <br>
        just skipped to this part please do not read on and start from the top and read.<br>
        I know I have already asked this question, most likely more times than I need to<br>
        but <span>WILL YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND?</span></p>
